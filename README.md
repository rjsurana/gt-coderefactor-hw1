For this project, I had several objectives when working on the code refactor.
The first objective was to meet user accesibility standards. This means that when a
user is browsing the website with a screen reading software, they are able to
understand what the images in the site are describing. This was accomplished by adding
alt tags anywhere there was an image tag and providing a concise description of the
picture. 

The second objective was to follow semantic html elements. This was accomplished
by replacing div tags with semantic html elements such as section or footer. 

The third objective was to place heading attributes in sequential order. This was
accomplished by making sure I followed the principles of headings- adding headers
in sequential order of importance.

Finally, in order for the website to have a presence on Google I researched Search
Engine Optimization and how to optimize the website. Adding a consise title that
describes the website as well as following HTML semantics helps to improve the 
SEO for the client's website.
